                <h2 class="section__header">Early Life</h2>
                <p class="section__description">Chester Charles Bennington, born in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 20, 1976,
                    to a nurse mother and a father who worked as a police detective specializing in child sexual abuse
                    cases. He grew up with two sisters and an older brother. Bennington's passion for music ignited
                    early, inspired by bands like Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots. He aspired to join Stone Temple
                    Pilots, eventually becoming their lead singer for a time. At age seven, an older male friend
                    sexually abused him. Bennington was afraid to ask for help, not wanting people to think he was gay
                    or a liar, and the abuse continued until age 13. In later years, he confided the identity of his
                    abuser to his father but opted against legal action.
