                <p>Responsive web design is an approach to make web pages render well on variety of devices.</p>
                <p>Before you write your first CSS line, HTML are responsive by default. It may not look good, but it is<em>responsive</em>. So, when you styling your page, and suddenly something broke, know that it is your fault. But don't worry, I am here to help you not wasting time scracthing your head. At least not as much as me.</p>
                <p>The rest of this page will show what's on your arsenal that you might not know.</p>

            <article class="section__article">
                <p>Media queries enable you to apply CSS styles based on a device's media type (e.g., print or screen) or its various attributes, including screen resolution, orientation, aspect ratio, browser viewport width or height, and user preferences like preferring reduced motion, data usage, or transparency.</p>
                <p>Below example will apply <span class="term">color: red;</span> into <span class="term">.container</span> when the screen width are <span class="term">600px</span> or above.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        @media (min-width: 600px) {
                            .container {
                                color: red;
                            }
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In your stylesheet, you can include different media queries to adjust your layout or parts of it for various screen sizes. These adjustments happen at specific points called breakpoints.</p>
                <p>Use your breakpoints when the page start to look bad at certain screen width.</p>

                <h3>Flexbox</h3>
                <p>In Flexbox, flex items shrink or grow, distributing space between the items according to the space in their container. By changing the values for <span class="term">flex-grow</span> and <span class="term">flex-shrink</span> you can indicate how you want the items to behave when they encounter more or less space around them.</p>
                <p>In the example below the flex items will each take an equal amount of space in the flex container, using the shorthand of <span class="term">flex: 1</span></p>

                <h3>Grid</h3>
                <p>In CSS Grid Layout the fr unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks. The next example creates a grid container with three tracks sized at 1fr. This will create three column tracks, each taking one part of the available space in the container.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        .container {

                            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
                          }

            <article class="section__article">
                <p>To ensure media is never larger than its responsive container, the following approach can be used:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        img,
                        video {
                        max-width: 100%;
                        }                                    
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This scales media to ensure they never overflow their containers. Using a single large image and scaling it down to fit small devices wastes bandwidth by downloading images larger than what is needed.</p>
                <p>Other useful tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always make sure to use an appropriate image format for your website images (such as PNG or JPG), and make sure to optimize the file size using a graphics editor before you put them on your website.</li>
                    <li>You can make use of CSS features like gradients and shadows to implement visual effects without using images.</li>
                    <li>You can use media queries inside the media attribute on <span class="term">&lt;source&gt;</span> elements nested inside &lt;video&gt;</span>/<span class="term">&lt;audio&gt;</span> elements to serve video/audio files as appropriate for different devices (responsive video/audio).</li>

            <p>Responsive typography describes changing font sizes within media queries or using viewport units to reflect lesser or greater amounts of screen real estate.</p>
            
            <article class="section__article">
                <h3>Using media queries for responsive typography</h3>
                <p>In this example, we want to set our level 1 heading to be <span class="term">4rem</span>, meaning it will be four times our base font size. That's a really large heading! We only want this jumbo heading on larger screen sizes, therefore we first create a smaller heading then use media queries to overwrite it with the larger size if we know that the user has a screen size of at least <span class="term">1200px</span>.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        html {
                            font-size: 1em;
                          }
                          
                          h1 {
                            font-size: 2rem;
                          }
                          
                          @media (min-width: 1200px) {
                            h1 {
                              font-size: 4rem;
                            }
                          }                          
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>On mobile the heading is smaller:</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design/mdn-rwd-font-mobile.png" alt="page mobile view">
                <p>On desktop, however, we see the larger heading size:</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design/mdn-rwd-font-desktop.png" alt="dekstop page view">
                <p>As this approach to typography shows, you do not need to restrict media queries to only changing the layout of the page. They can be used to tweak any element to make it more usable or attractive at alternate screen sizes.</p>

                <h3>Using viewport units for responsive typography</h3>
                <P>Viewport units <span class="term">vw</span> can also be used to enable responsive typography, without the need for setting breakpoints with media queries. <span class="term">1vw</span> is equal to one percent of the viewport width, meaning that if you set your font size using <span class="term">vw</span>, it will always relate to the size of the viewport.</P>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                            font-size: 6vw;
                          }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>The problem with doing the above is that the user loses the ability to zoom any text set using the vw unit, as that text is always related to the size of the viewport. <span class="highlight">Therefore you should never set text using viewport units alone.</span></p>
                <p>There is a solution, and it involves using <span class="term">calc()</span>. If you add the <span class="term">vw</span> unit to a value set using a fixed size such as <span class="term">em</span>s or <span class="term">rem</span>s then the text will still be zoomable. Essentially, the <span class="term">vw</span> unit adds on top of that zoomed value:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                            font-size: calc(1.5rem + 3vw);
                          }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This means that we only need to specify the font size for the heading once, rather than set it up for mobile and redefine it in the media queries. The font then gradually increases as you increase the size of the viewport.</p>

        <section id="viewport" class="section main-section">
            <header>Viewport meta tag</header>
            <article class="section__article">
                <p>If you look at the HTML source of a responsive page, you will usually see the following <span class="term">&lt;meta&gt;</span> tag in the <span class="term">&lt;head&gt;</span> of the document.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"/&gt
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This viewport meta tag tells mobile browsers that they should set the width of the viewport to the device width, and scale the document to 100% of its intended size, which shows the document at the mobile-optimized size that you intended.</p>
                <p>Why is this needed? Because mobile browsers tend to lie about their viewport width.</p>
                <p>This meta tag exists because when smartphones first arrived, most sites were not mobile optimized. The mobile browser would, therefore, set the viewport width to 980 pixels, render the page at that width, and show the result as a zoomed-out version of the desktop layout. Users could zoom in and pan around the website to view the bits they were interested in, but it looked bad.</p>
                <p>By setting <span class="term">width=device-width</span> you are overriding a mobile device's default, like Apple's default <span class="term">width=980px</span>, with the actual width of the device. Without it, your responsive design with breakpoints and media queries may not work as intended on mobile browsers. If you've got a narrow screen layout that kicks in at 480px viewport width or less, but the device is saying it is 980px wide, that user will not see your narrow screen layout.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">So you should <em>always</em> include the viewport meta tag in the head of your documents.</span></p>

                <p>Responsive design refers to a site or application design that responds to the environment in which it is viewed. It encompasses a number of CSS and HTML features and techniques and is now essentially just how we build websites by default. Consider the sites that you visit on your phone — it is probably fairly unusual to come across a site that is the desktop version scaled down, or where you need to scroll sideways to find things. This is because the web has moved to this approach of designing responsively.</p>
                <p>It has also become much easier to achieve responsive designs with the help of the layout methods you have learned in these lessons. If you are new to web development today you have many more tools at your disposal than in the early days of responsive design. It is therefore worth checking the age of any materials you are using. While the historical articles are still useful, modern use of CSS and HTML makes it far easier to create elegant and useful designs, no matter what device your visitor views the site with.</p>
